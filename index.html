            <h2>Background & Likes</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Angel Jaime</strong>, I’m 20 years old, I was born in Guanajuato, Mexico, and I’m
                studying to be a Software Developer in the future. Throughout my life I have lived in many places. For
                the first few years of my life I lived in Mexico and it was until my 5th birthday that I came to live in
                the U.S, more specifically, to Houston. After that I moved to Florida, and in 2018 I moved to Dallas,
                which is where l now live.</p>

            <p>For the last 5 years I have also been a freelance photographer. I like EDM music and would also like to
                make a song of my own sometime. I’m also into videogames, although for the last few months I haven't had
                much time to play anything. Recently, I also got into watching movies, though I still can’t pick a
                favorite. Lastly, I'm also into tech, Marvel movies, and I also love to collect Lego Marvel Minifigures
            </p>

            <h2>Photography</h2>
            <p>I started my photography journey in 2018, but despite that, I still haven’t found the genre I want to
                commit to.
                Sometimes I do portraits, other times I do landscapes, street photography, toy photography, or any other
                type I feel like doing. Because of this, I have learned to be versatile and adapt to what needs to be
                photographed.
            </p>

            <p>Since I come from a small town, many people consider me one of the best photographers in town and I
                take that with great pride, so I always do my best so my photos can reflect that. Here are some examples
                of my work:</p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Music is a great way to learn about someone, and for me, it is an integral part of my life. For almost a
                decade, my favorite artist has been <i>Hardwell</i>, a Dutch DJ who mainly plays EDM, and a few months
                ago I finally got the chance to meet him, which was definitely the best moment in my life.</p>

            <p>Other artists who had a big impact on me were Avicii and Daft Punk, whose music I truly recommend to
                anyone. While I do listen to a variety of genres, EDM is the one that represents me the most, and here
                is a short list of songs that I love:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Strobe - Deadmau5</li>
                <li>We’ll be Coming Back - Calvin Harris</li>
                <li>Face to Face - Daft Punk</li>
                <li>Papercut - Zedd</li>
                <li>Flatline - Hardwell</li>
            </ul>
